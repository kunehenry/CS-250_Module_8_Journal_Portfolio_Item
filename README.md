# CS-250 Module 8 Journal: Portfolio Item 

## Overview 

This repository is a testament to the practical application of the agile and Scrum practices learned in the CS-250 course. It houses the Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable for CS-250's final project, a valuable item that significantly enriching my ongoing academic portfolio. The content here highlights the application of these methodologies and integrates insights from the project to highlight how they have shaped my development practices and understanding of software engineering. 

## Sprint Review and Retrospective 

The final project, SNHU Travel, by ChadaTech, represents a significant shift from traditional waterfall methodologies to agile, specifically Scrum. This transition is not just a change in approach but a transformative journey that underscores my adaptability and understanding of the dynamic nature of modern software development in responding to user needs and enhancing team collaboration. The document detailed here evaluates the project's execution, the effectiveness of communication strategies, and organizational tools, providing a comprehensive overview of the successes and challenges. 

## Reflections on Essential Questions 

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this? 

Acted as the Product Owner role, I played a pivotal part in interpreting user needs for our project. I engaged directly with stakeholders through regular feedback sessions and utilized user personas and detailed user stories to ensure development aligned closely with user needs. Creating user stories was a vital part of this process, as it translated abstract user requirements into concrete tasks, making them actionable for the development team. This approach helped maintain relevance and ensured the product evolved based on direct user feedback and observed behaviors. 

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I want to incorporate into my future development work? 

My approach to developing programs is iterative and feedback-driven, characteristics central to agile methodologies. With its sprints and constant stakeholder engagement, the Scrum framework allows flexibility and rapid adaptation to change, which is essential in today's fast-paced development environments. In future projects, I am not just considering, but I am eagerly committed to integrating further practices like Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) to enhance development efficiency and product quality. 

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 

Being a good team member in software development means more than just completing tasks. It involves:

- actively contributing to a collaborative environment, 

- sharing knowledge, and 

- supporting peers in overcoming challenges. 

For example, during the SNHU Travel project, as a Scrum Master, I facilitated effective communication and problem-solving, which were crucial in maintaining project momentum and alignment with goals. Emphasizing transparency, accountability, and collective ownership are practices I intend to uphold in all team settings. 

## Conclusion 

This portfolio reflects the technical skills and methodologies learned and encapsulates my growth as a team player and a developer who can effectively respond to changing environments. It serves as a benchmark for future projects and a testament to the learning undertaken in this course.
